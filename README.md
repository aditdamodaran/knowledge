I'm compiling a list of 100 resources that I've found useful for referencing. Some links are about development and design &mdash; things that can be studied, practiced, and perhaps mastered. Other links are about less tangible topics &mdash; direction, fulfillment, and empathy. By limiting myself to 100 resources, I will eventually need to make tradeoffs between what to include and what to discard. Please feel free to report an issue with any links that no longer work.
